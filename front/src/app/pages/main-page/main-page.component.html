					<span>Chronic myeloid leukemia is a very dangerous disease.
						About 15% of all leukemia is CML. <a>The American Cancer Societyâ€™s</a>
						estimates for chronic myeloid leukemia in the US for 2022 are:</span>
					<ul>
						<li>About 8,860 new cases will be diagnosed with CML</li>
						<li>About 1,220 people will die of CML</li>
					</ul>
					<span>About 1 person in 526 will get CML in their lifetime in the US.
						And currently there is no medicine that would effectively combat this disease.</span>
					<span>The process of drug development is very time-consuming and expensive. Currently, there are several types
						of inhibitors, but they are not able to block any mutations of leukemia. And although scientists are
						actively
						working to find a solution, at the moment the problem remains unresolved.</span>

					One of the possible solutions that will speed up the process of finding the necessary medicine is a combined
					approach: simultaneous use of computer modeling methods and generative neural networks. The purpose of our
					work
					is to generate in this way a multikinase inhibitor, which will be unique for every mutation.
